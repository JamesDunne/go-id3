General
-------
  - ID3 v1 support
  - ID3 v2.x code can be deduplicated
  - ID3 (un)synchronization handling
  - ID3 v2.4 timestamp parsing
  - Pictures!

Unicode support
---------------
  - UTF-16BE needs to be tested
  - Variable length UTF-16 strings are probably handled incorrectly
  - UTF-16 w/o BOM needs to be tested
  - expand() in id3.go is pretty silly due to how Go handles ISO/IEC 8859-1 characters
