TODO

I've listed a bunch of ID3 frames that weren't listed as part of the spec. I'm
pretty sure we can ignore them but hey might as well list them here for
completeness.


General
-------
  - ID3 v2.x code can be deduplicated
  - ID3 (un)synchronization handling
  - Pictures!


ID3 v1
------
  - Everything


ID3 v2.2
--------
  - Length
  - CM1 frame
  - IPP frame
  - PCS frame
  - TCT frame
  - TDR frame
  - TID frame
  - WFD frame


ID3 v2.3 support
--------
  - NCON frame
  - TCMP frame
  - TDEN frame
  - TDTG frame
  - RGAD frame
  - XSOP frame
  - Merge with v2.4 code?


ID3 v2.4
--------
  - TCMP frame
  - Merge with v2.3 code?


Unicode support
---------------
  - UTF-16BE needs to be tested
  - Variable length UTF-16 strings are probably handled incorrectly
  - UTF-16 w/o BOM needs to be tested
  - expand() in id3.go is pretty silly due to how Go handles ISO/IEC 8859-1 characters
